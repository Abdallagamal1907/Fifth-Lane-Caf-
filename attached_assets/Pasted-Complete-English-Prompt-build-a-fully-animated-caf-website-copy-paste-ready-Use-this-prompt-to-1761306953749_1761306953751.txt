Gallery & images

Provide 24–30 images total: 6–8 hero/background images (high-res), 18–22 gallery images (product, barista, interior, lifestyle).

Recommended image sizes: hero/background 1920×1080 or 2560×1440; gallery 1200×800 or 800×600 compressed WebP.

Use Unsplash/Pexels stock initially, and allow easy replacement with client photos. Provide suggested filenames: hero-01.jpg, interior-wide-01.jpg, barista-espresso-01.jpg, pastry-01.jpg, street-10thramadan-01.jpg, etc.

Accessibility & performance

Images lazy-loaded with low-res blur-up placeholders.

Provide prefers-reduced-motion fallback: reduce/disable non-essential motion.

Semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, accessible forms, keyboard navigable modals (gallery lightbox, nav).

Lighthouse score target: >= 90 performance and accessibility where possible.

Animation & interaction requirements — THE MOST IMPORTANT PART

Make every visible element have thoughtful motion. Prioritize smooth, performant animations and micro-interactions. Use Framer Motion (preferred) for component animations and GSAP only for advanced timeline control if needed. Use Lottie for decorative icon animations.

Global animation philosophy: warm, snappy, slightly playful — fast micro-interactions (80–200ms) for hover states; slower reveal motions (300–700ms) for scroll entrance. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Specific animation list (implement all)

Hero

Parallax background layers: background image moves slower than foreground text on scroll (subtle).

Large headline: entrance animation — split text reveal (mask/clip) with stagger (use Framer Motion staggerChildren).

CTA buttons: continuous but subtle hover pulse + micro-translateY and micro-shadow on hover.

Decorative Lottie steam animation above cup icon near headline.

Navigation

Smooth slide-in mobile nav from right with backdrop blur.

Active nav item underline: animated SVG line draw.

On scroll, nav transitions from transparent to semi-opaque with smooth color/height change.

Hero & Background overlays

Animated gradient overlays (subtle shifting) and an optional particle field (very light) for hero background; particles reduce or stop on mobile/low-power devices.

Section scroll reveals

Each section uses fade + slide up with 50–100ms stagger between children.

Cards reveal with 3D tilt perspective on hover (small rotateX / rotateY) and subtle shadow lift.

Menu items/cards

Card hover: scale to 1.03, translateY -6px, box-shadow deepens, and a hover micro-illustration (Lottie) or svg flourish appears.

Price and short description animate into view on hover (slide left + fade).

Add to Order / More Info button: ripple/ink effect on click (CSS + JS) and pressed animation (scale down 0.98).

Image interactions

Gallery images: hover zoom (scale 1.06) + parallax sub-layer movement based on mouse position (subtle).

Lightbox open: image zoom-in with fade, background blur, and close button morph animation.

Lazy images: use blur-up placeholder that crossfades to full-res.

Buttons & CTAs

Hover: translateY(-4px), shadow grow, and a small color gradient sweep animation across text.

Primary CTAs have micro-bounce on entrance and gentle breathing animation when idle (very subtle).

Forms & Inputs

Input focus: animated underline/or floating label transition.

Submit button: progress indicator animation (linear bar or spinner) on submit, success checkmark morph animation on complete.

Map & Location

Animated pin drop on map load; location card slides in from map edge.

Hovering on address reveals small animated route line.

Testimonials

Carousel with animated card entrance, auto-advance with pause on hover; testimonial card flip/slide animation.

Footer

Social icons: hover micro-animations (scale, rotate, or icon-specific Lottie).

Back to top: floating animated button that pulses then hides on scroll down.

Micro-interactions everywhere

Links have animated underlines, icons have tiny hover transforms, toast messages slide and fade with progress bar.

Advanced transitions

Route transitions (if using Next.js): page transition animations with shared element transitions for hero images (Framer Motion layoutId).

Use Timeline sequencing for complex flows (GSAP or Framer Motion useAnimation).

Performance & progressive enhancement

Limit concurrent animations; use will-change responsibly.

Disable heavy effects on small viewports or when prefers-reduced-motion is set.

Use hardware-accelerated transforms (translateZ, transform) instead of animating top/left where possible.

Provide a toggle in site settings to reduce / disable animations.

Developer notes & deliverables

Provide source code (Git repo) with proper README and deployment steps (Vercel / Netlify instructions).

Include a components library (Button, Card, Modal, Nav, Gallery, MenuCard) and storybook snapshots or usage examples.

Provide a lightweight CSS variables theme (colors, spacing, type scale).

Provide a list of stock image links (30 images) used and guidelines for replacing with client photography.

Provide a one-page “Animation spec” document mapping each animation to components and durations/easings.

Provide optional production build with image optimization (Next/Image or equivalent) and critical CSS inline for first paint.

Acceptance criteria

Desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive with tested interactions on Chrome, Firefox, Safari (iOS/Android).

All pages present the given English copy exactly and menu items as above.

Animations look smooth (60fps where possible), respect reduced-motion, and degrade gracefully.

Code is modular, commented, and ready for handoff.

Quick developer hint (short)

If you implement with Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion + Lottie + optionally GSAP, you’ll easily meet the visual and animation requirements and have a maintainable codebase. Use Framer Motion for route transitions and shared element animations (layoutId). Use IntersectionObserver to trigger scroll reveals.
